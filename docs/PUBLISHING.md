# Publish this project on GitHub

These instructions publish **source code**, not a running service. The application needs a server; GitHub Pages cannot run this backend.

## 1. Prepare your local folder

Extract the clean project ZIP and open a terminal **inside this project's folder**, where `README.md`, `.gitignore` and `docker-compose.yml` are located. Publish the extracted files, not the ZIP itself. Keep each of the three applications in a separate repository.

Install Git and sign in to GitHub. If using HTTPS, Git Credential Manager can open your browser for authentication. Never put an access token in a remote URL.

The release contains `.env.example` with blank secrets. Copy it to `.env` only on your development/deployment machine. `.env`, databases, uploaded files, logs and backups are excluded by `.gitignore`. Existing runtime data has not been included. Keep the supplied `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.

## 2. Create an empty repository

On GitHub, choose **New repository**, select its owner, choose a name and visibility, and click **Create repository**. Do not initialize it with a README, license or `.gitignore`: this folder already has its own files.

Suggested names: `panopticon-lite`, `videochat`, `catasync`. A public repository makes the source and included assets visible to everyone. No project license was present in the archives; select a license appropriate to the rights you hold before granting reuse rights. Existing third-party licenses still apply.

## 3. Commit and push

The following Git commands work in PowerShell, Bash and most terminals. Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY` with your actual values.

```sh
git init
git branch -M main
git status --short
git add .
git diff --cached --stat
git diff --cached --name-only
git commit -m "Prepare multilingual public release"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
git push -u origin main
```

Before committing, check the staged file list. It should contain source files, documentation and `.env.example`, not `.env`, database files, uploads or backups. Do not use `git add -f` to bypass the ignore rules.

If Git asks for your identity, set your own name and GitHub email (or GitHub's private noreply address):

```sh
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL"
```

Then repeat the commit and push. If a remote already exists, inspect it with `git remote -v`; use `git remote set-url origin ...` only to deliberately change it. A rejected push to a nonempty repository should be reconciled with its history; do not force-push over other work.

## 4. Review the repository

Open the repository and verify that the README is displayed, the file tree is correct and the Actions checks finish. Set the description and topics in **About**. Review the language catalogs and installation instructions. The included container publishing workflow, where present, is manual; pushing source does not deploy a service.

For a versioned release after verification:

```sh
git tag v1.1.0-i18n
git push origin v1.1.0-i18n
```

Use another unused version tag if this one already exists. You can then create a GitHub Release from the tag. Do not attach archives containing your local `.env` or runtime data.

## 5. Publish later changes

```sh
git status
git add .
git diff --cached
git commit -m "Describe the change"
git push
```

Deploy separately on your server using the main README. Never use this clean release to overwrite a production database.
